## What is the timeline?

**There is no timeline with exact dates, but we know what is on the horizon.**

A lot of people think that (1) languages are just features that need implementing, (2) these features should be placed on a calendar, and (3) we should throw people at the features until they are done early. This is not how Elm has developed!

First, when it comes to language design, doing things *right* is way more important than doing things *right now*. It is easy to think short term and rush features, but languages live for decades, and there are no take-backs on mistakes!

Second, looking back, playfulness and inspiration have been crucial parts of Elm’s development. For example, the friendly error messages began with a project to provide JSON output to code editors. There was no huge demand for JSON output, but after spending a bit of time on the project, it became clear that the error messages could be dramatically improved. No one knew that was possible! That means no one was asking for it either! So by any reasonable prioritization scheme, this was a “pointless” project, but it turned into an extremely valuable part of Elm!

Point is, I think scheduling progress is kind of a silly idea. “That conceptual breakthrough is scheduled for September!” Listening and experimenting are a part of the process. It has been extremely valuable to Elm so far, and I expect that to continue to be true!

## How do I make a single-page app?

**You can get 90% of the way there now, and 0.19 will smooth this out significantly.**

The major focus of 0.19 will be creating “single-page apps” in Elm. The features that fall under that umbrella include:

  - Server-side rendering
  - Tree shaking (a.k.a. dead code elimination)
  - Code splitting
  - Lazy loading
  - Routing

Once it is possible to create “real” single-page apps thanks to these features, we will also have friendly documentation about how to do it.

> **Note:** It is still too early to say exactly which features will be in the release and how everything will work. Perhaps not all of these features *should* be in the first iteration. Maybe if one is cut, the others can be realesed earlier. That kind of thing. Point is, this list is more about what the major concerns are.

Now some people evaluating Elm may *need* need these features for a particular project. Perhaps every millisecond of page load has significant impact on revenue? I recommend measuring things. If your Elm bundle is 30kb gzipped, you may actually be competitive with other options. But imagining that it cannot work for you, it is a totally reasonable choice to hold off on using Elm for now. We will get there, and I hope you circle back after 0.19 and evaluate Elm again. That’s what [Scott is doing](https://twitter.com/scottcorgan/status/857586663261949954)!

Most cases are not nearly so extreme. If you are one of the 99% of developers with different tradeoffs, I recommend treating each “page” as a separate Elm module, and then having a “routing” module that uses [elm-lang/navigation](https://github.com/elm-lang/navigation), [evancz/url-parser](https://github.com/evancz/url-parser), `Cmd.map`, and `Sub.map` to swap between pages. This will set you up well for 0.19 which will provide a much nicer alternative to that “routing” layer.

## Can I use Elm on servers?

**No, and if we started today, this would still be a multi-year project.**

There is a great deal of excitement about Elm on servers. I think this is partially due to a couple common misconceptions about running the same language on the front-end and back-end:

  * Folks want to share types. No more JSON! That *sounds* amazing, but what happens when a user keeps a tab open for months? If you share types directly, changing types will break their code. Creating a serialization format that can evolve with your product is a very hard problem and simply “having types” does not solve it.

  * People want server-side rendering of HTML. Running a server all in Elm does not really give you this. I mean, it can, but it is way more complicated than having a tool that can take Elm modules and spit out HTML. The simpler version can work with any existing server, which is why that is the approach being explored for 0.19!

  * Folks like to think languages are “general purpose” and if the language is good, it should be good at *anything*. People say C++ is a general purpose language, but it is not so nice for web apps. People say Python is a general purpose language, but it is not so good for operating systems. And you cannot just “make Python good at operating systems” by compiling it to C.

I think the main thing you get from “Elm on servers” is the ability to share some libraries and to have common tooling. That is still pretty neat, and perhaps worthwhile. That said, **I think it is a better strategy to make Elm an extremely strong choice for web apps before expanding to other domains.** There is still a lot of work to do for web apps!

And before you try to do it yourself...

## When will Elm compile to X?

Many folks tell me “Elm should compile to X” where X is a thing they like. Here are people suggesting [Go](https://twitter.com/zvozin/status/847860742787223553), [Lua](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-dev/Mi9j3nVD5NE/11akZGmNAgAJ) and [Erlang](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-dev/Mi9j3nVD5NE/Pf1GXS2QAgAJ). But why not go through OCaml or C# or Java or or Scala or F# or Haskell or ES6 or C++ or Rust or node.js?

**The hard part of supporting a domain is not the compiler. It is making a good ecosystem.** Python is nice for scientific computing because of things like NumPy and SciPy, not because of whatever backend. Elm is nice for front-end because of the ecosystem, like the HTML library and The Elm Architecture, not the particulars of code generation. **Just putting a typed functional language in a domain does not mean it will be fun and productive in practice!**

So say we choose to go through Erlang to make Elm a server language too. Great. Now the question is “how do you write a typed server with no side-effects that is (1) true to the spirit of Elm and (2) feels nicer than other server languages?” That's the hard question, and the answer may be that it cannot be done. So writing a compiler backend is like 5% of what it takes to make a project like this worthwhile. And ultimately, the ideal form of a project like this has its own bespoke backend, going to assembly directly.

If you want to explore this more, *please* watch [Code is the Easy Part](https://youtu.be/DSjbTC-hvqQ) first. It gets into how to collaborate in the Elm community, and I would recommend any of [these projects](https://github.com/elm-lang/projects) over starting down this path as a first project within Elm.
